step 1 :
sudo yum install wget
step 2 :
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
step 3:
edit .bash_profile to define env variable
export M2_HOME=/home/ec2-user/apache-maven-3.9.9
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
PATH=$PATH:$M2
then run 
source ~/.bash_profile 
1. export M2_HOME=/root/apache-maven-3.9.9
üó£Ô∏è "Hey system, Maven is installed in this folder: /root/apache-maven-3.9.9."

This sets an environment variable called M2_HOME that points to where Maven is installed.

2. export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
üó£Ô∏è "Create another variable called M2 that points to the bin folder inside Maven."

So now:
M2 = /root/apache-maven-3.9.9/bin

The bin folder is where the mvn command actually lives.

3. PATH=$PATH:$M2
üó£Ô∏è "Add the M2 folder to the system PATH."

PATH is a list of places the system looks when you type a command like mvn.
By adding $M2, you're saying:
"Include the folder where the mvn command is, so I can run mvn from anywhere."

When you add something (like environment variables) to .bash_profile, it won‚Äôt take effect until you log out and log back in, or until you reload the file.
